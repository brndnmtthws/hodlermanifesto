## Rule 1: A True HODLer Does Not Sell Their Bitcoin

The first and most important rule of the HODLer Manifesto is to never sell your
Bitcoin. A HODLer may spend Bitcoin (see rule 5), but **a HODLer does not
sell**. Only the weak sell, and they soon regret doing so.

## Rule 2: A True HODLer Buys the Dip

If the fiat price of Bitcoin drops, a HODLer will buy more, provided they
have the means to do so. **Under no circumstances would a HODLer panic sell
because they see the price going down**. The only case where a HODLer is not
regularly buying the dips is when all their fiat is already invested.

## Rule 3: A True HODLer Remains Steadfast In Spite of FUD

Whether there's news that China is banning Bitcoin again, or your favourite
exchanged got hacked, a HODLer will continue to HODL. A HODLer stays the course
regardless of who is sowing seeds of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Disregard the
news. Remember that the naysayers are usually those who have a lot to lose from 
Bitcoin's success, or those who resent HODLers for going to the moon.

## Rule 4: A True HODLer Keeps Their Bitcoins Off Exchanges and Online Wallets

No exchange or online wallet is immune from rogue employees, security mistakes,
or simple negligence. A HODLer will keep their Bitcoins secure by using a paper or
hardware wallet, instead of relying on any third parties for custody or safe
keeping. **A HODLer always controls their own private keys**.

## Rule 5: A True HODLer Buys Goods and Services With Their Bitcoin

If you decide to spend your Bitcoins, find vendors who accept your Bitcoins directly
rather than using fiat-based bridges (such as prepaid Visa cards). By spending
your Bitcoins, you fuel the ecosystem of fellow HODLers.  Do not become a
spendthrift either, or you will soon find yourself without Bitcoin.

## Rule 6: A True HODLer Spreads the Good Word

Do tell your friends and family about the goodness of Bitcoin, but do not be
pushy, or pressure others into buying Bitcoin. They may not share the same
values as you. Try to educate them without being patronizing, and stick to the
facts rather than appealing to emotions (like FOMO). Refer them to good
resources, and let them make up their own mind.

## Rule 7: A True HODLer Does Not Get FOMO When Another Coin Rises

When you see other coins quickly rising in market cap rankings, you will not be
distracted. They too will fall back from whence they came. Resist the temptation
to dump your Bitcoin and go along with another. This is usually a futile exercise.
If you do decide to purchase a new coin, weight your holdings by market cap to
manage your risk.

## Rule 8: A True HODLer Will Run Their Own Full Node

To ensure their Bitcoin remains healthy, and to participate in consensus, a HODLer
runs their own full node if possible. There is truth in numbers, and a HODLer
will always remain true to Bitcoin.
